In Python, variable names must follow certain rules to ensure that the code is valid and works properly. Here's a breakdown of the key rules for naming variables in Python:

1. Valid Characters
  
Variable names can contain:
Letters (a-z, A-Z)
Digits (0-9), but not as the first character.
Underscores (_)
  
2. First Character
  
The first character of a variable name must be a letter or an underscore (_).
Cannot start with a number.
Examples of valid first characters:

x
_variable
var1
Examples of invalid first characters:

1variable (starts with a number)
  
3. Case Sensitivity
  
Python is case-sensitive, meaning that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as different characters.
Examples:

myVariable and myvariable are two different variables.
  
4. Keywords (Reserved Words)
  
Python has a set of reserved words (also known as keywords), which are part of the language syntax. These cannot be used as variable names.
Some examples of Python keywords:

if, else, while, for, def, class, True, False, import, None, etc.
You can check the list of reserved keywords in Python using the keyword module:

import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)
  
5. Length of the Name
  
Python does not impose any strict limit on the length of variable names, but it is recommended to keep them meaningful and not too long.
  
6. Use of Underscores in Python Naming:
  
Single Leading Underscore (_variable): Indicates internal use, suggesting "private" (not strictly enforced).
Double Leading Underscore (__variable): Triggers name mangling to avoid subclass conflicts.
Single Trailing Underscore (variable_): Used to avoid conflicts with Python keywords (e.g., class_).
Double Leading and Trailing Underscore (__variable__): Reserved for special methods (e.g., __init__, __str__).
  
7. No Spaces
  
Variable names cannot contain spaces. Use underscores instead if needed.
Valid: my_variable Invalid: my variable

8. No Special Characters
  
You cannot use special characters such as @, #, $, %, etc., in variable names.
  
9. Global vs Local Variables
  
If you want to use a variable globally across multiple functions, make sure you declare it at the top of the script. If a variable is only meant for a specific function, it should be declared within that function scope.
Examples of Valid Variable Names:

x = 10
total_amount = 100.5
user_name = "Alice"
myVariable = 45
_class = "Test"
totalAmount1 = 25
Examples of Invalid Variable Names:
  
1variable = 10  # Starts with a number
class = "example"  # Reserved keyword
user-name = "Bob"  # Contains a hyphen
total@amount = 30  # Contains a special character

  VALID NAMES:
  
  my_variable = 10
totalAmount = 25
_class = "test"
  
  INVALID NAMES:
  
  1variable = 10  # Starts with a number
class = "test"  # Reserved keyword
my variable = 5  # Contains space
